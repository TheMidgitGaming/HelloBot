This stores the user input as the variable name and then prints hello and then the variable called name <-- Comment saying what the program does

def hello():    <-- Tells Python what we want to create a new function called hello().

    print("What's your name?") <-- The print command shows basic text on the screen which will ask the user the question
    
    name = input() <-- This confronts the user with an input and stores that as a variable called 'name'
    
    print("Hello, " + str(name))  <-- Prints the string hello and adds the user's name at the end.


hello() <-- This activates / calls our function
